1.  Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in
    reverse order with a space between them.

2.  Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user
    and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.
    Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
    Output :
    List : ['3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23']
    Tuple : ('3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23')

3.  Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list.
    color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]

4.  Write a Python program to print the documents (syntax, description etc.) of Python built-in
    function(s).
    Sample function : abs()
    Expected Result : mat
    abs(number) -> number
    Return the absolute value of the argument.
5.  Write a Python program to print the calendar of a given month and year.
    Note : Use 'calendar' module.

6.  Write a Python program to calculate number of days between two dates.
    Sample dates : (2014, 7, 2), (2014, 7, 11)
    Expected output : 9 days

7.  Write a Python program to check whether a specified value is contained in a group of values.
    Test Data :
    3 -> [1, 5, 8, 3] : True
    -1 -> [1, 5, 8, 3] : False

8.  Write a Python program to create a histogram from a given list of integers.

9.  Write a Python program to concatenate all elements in a list into a string and return it.

10. Write a Python program to print out a set containing all the colors from color_list_1 which
    are not present in color_list_2.
    Test Data :
    color_list_1 = set(["White", "Black", "Red"])
    color_list_2 = set(["Red", "Green"])
    Expected Output :
    {'Black', 'White'}
